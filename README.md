# Retail inventory management
Simple CLI-based application for retail inventory management, built as a capstone project for "Building Applications with OOP in Python" track on DataCamp.

## Description

This Python application manages an inventory of products and allows for basic order placement functionality. The application uses object-oriented programming (OOP) principles such as classes, inheritance, and class methods to model products and orders. It provides functionality to add, update, and delete products, as well as place orders for products. The app allows for limited orders of one product at a time, with the ability to track product quantities and update order details.

## Key Learning Outcomes

* Demonstrated understanding of class creation and instantiation.
* Implemented class methods for managing inventory data.
* Utilized inheritance to extend functionality between `Product` and `Order` classes.
* Used class methods to manipulate shared class-level data (inventory).
* Gained experience in managing object relationships (e.g., `Order` containing references to `Product`).

## Project Structure

* `main.py`: Contains the script for running the application, initializing products, and placing orders. It also contains Product and Order classes.

## Acknowledgements

This project was created as part of the "Building Applications with OOP in Python" track on DataCamp. The track provided foundational knowledge of object-oriented programming principles, which were applied in this project.

## Enhancements

I'm planning to redesing this project to be properly designed, applying SOLID principles.

## Conclusion

Feel free to give suggestions and feebacks!
